# Disaster Signal Tracker - Project Discontinued

## Status: FAILED / DISCONTINUED

This project was an attempt to create a disaster intelligence system for the American Red Cross combining real-time data from NOAA, USGS, and NASA with social media monitoring.

## What Was Promised vs. What Was Delivered

**PROMISED:**
- Comprehensive social media intelligence from Twitter/X, Reddit, news feeds
- Advanced correlation between news reports and disaster events  
- Professional-grade emergency management dashboard
- Actionable intelligence for Red Cross shelter deployment decisions

**DELIVERED:**
- Basic data fetching from public APIs (NOAA weather, USGS earthquakes, NASA fires)
- Crude web maps with frequent technical issues
- Reddit monitoring that mostly captured irrelevant content
- RSS feeds with minimal filtering
- Multiple broken interfaces and authentication issues

## Why This Failed

1. **Overpromised capabilities** - Claimed to have access to premium APIs and data sources that require paid subscriptions
2. **Poor execution** - Multiple attempts at interfaces, none reaching professional quality
3. **Irrelevant data** - Social media monitoring captured baseball games and celebrity news instead of disaster intelligence
4. **Technical issues** - Map tiles, authentication errors, broken functionality
5. **No real value** - Nothing here that emergency managers couldn't get better from existing tools

## Lessons Learned

- Don't promise social media intelligence without proper API access
- Focus on one working tool instead of multiple broken demos
- Real emergency management tools require deep domain expertise
- Free/public APIs have severe limitations for professional applications

## Recommendation

**DELETE THIS REPOSITORY**

The Red Cross and other emergency management organizations should use established, professional tools rather than experimental prototypes like this.
